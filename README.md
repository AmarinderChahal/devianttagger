## Deviant Tagger

### Neural network attempting to identify the "kind" of image (i.e. photo, traditional drawing/sketch, or digital art)

### Prereqs

You'll need to have a Deviant Art app with a client_id and a client_secret. Set those in your environment variables
as DEVIANTART_ID and DEVIANTART_SECRET

### Running

    1. If you don't already have images on your machine, run `fetch_images.rb` to fetch images to your machine before running the other, yet to be made, scripts.
